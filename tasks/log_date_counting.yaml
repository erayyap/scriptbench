task_specification:
  description: |
    The task is to develop a Python script that parses a log file (`benchmark_log.log`) and counts how many lines contain a valid event timestamp. Make sure the script can run on its own without needing any args. The log file will be in the folder where the script will run in. The objective is to handle a complex log containing many different formats, many of which deliberately mimic date formats without actually being timestamps (like version numbers or transaction IDs). The script should be robust enough to differentiate between legitimate timestamps and these misleading patterns. It will take a single command-line argument for the input file path, process the file line by line, and must output a single line to the command line in the format `ANSWER=[COUNT]`. A line should only be counted if it contains a substring that represents a true calendar date and/or time of day, serving the purpose of marking when an event occurred. Valid examples include common formats such as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, ISO 8601, RFC 2822 (e.g., `Fri, 27 Oct 2023`), or formats with named months. Exclusions include data that only looks like dates but are not timestamps, such as software version numbers (`v2024.01.15`), transaction IDs (`20231027-a4b7c1d3`), directory paths with date components (`/var/log/2023/10/27/`), product SKUs, or IP addresses. The acceptance criteria emphasize accuracy: the script must capture legitimate timestamps regardless of their position in the line while rejecting false positives based on contextual clues.
