  description: |
    Write a Python script named `check_smells.py` that checks how many smells are present in "./main.py" (Present in the folder I will run the script in.)
    
    The script must analyze the target file for the following code smells:
    
    1.  **Long Line Length**: Count any line with more than 99 characters.
    2.  **Long Parameter List**: Count any function definition with more than 5 parameters.
    3.  **High Cyclomatic Complexity**: Count any function with a complexity score greater than 5. For this task, calculate complexity as `1 +` the total number of `if`, `for`, `while`, `and`, `or`, and `except` handlers within the function.
    4.  **Unexplained Numbers in Logic**: Count hard-coded numbers that appear directly within logical conditions, decisions, or mathematical calculations. A number should *not* be counted if its purpose is to define a value, such as when it is being assigned to a variable or when it serves as a data value inside a collection like a list or dictionary. The common utility numbers `0`, `1`, and `-1` should always be ignored.

    After analyzing the file, the script must print the total count of all detected smells combined to the terminal in the exact format "ANSWER=x", where x is the total integer count.
